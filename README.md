# MySTDs - My Standard (Library)

Welcome to **mystds**, your new best friend in the world of Go programming! Before you start thinking this is some medical tool for tracking unspeakable infections, let me clarify: **mystds** stands for **My Standard Library**. Yep, you heard it right. It's my personal collection of standard patterns (and anti-patterns) to speed up all my pet projects. 
You can find: **mychannels**, **mytests**, **myshutdown** for now and many more in near future.

## Why the name?

Good question! It's a play on words - because who doesn't love a bit of humor in their project names? While it might sound like something you’d rather not discuss over dinner, in reality, it’s all about making your Go projects more efficient, maintainable, and fun to work on. Plus, it’s a great conversation starter!

## What is mystds?

mystds is a collection of reusable Go code snippets, patterns, utilities, and (sometimes) quirky anti-patterns. It’s like having your very own toolkit, filled with all the goodies you’ve found (or learned the hard way) while working on various projects. Think of it as your Go-to standard library (pun totally intended).

## What this is not?

This is not ready for production use right now. I just started writing it and I haven't really tested it. I am about to plug **mystds**...to...my...(barf)...projects. Oh this is a terrible name.


## Important Notes

1. **Optimization Philosophy**
   - I didn't optimize for execution speed. I optimized for ease-of-use. If there are some low-hanging fruits to optimize for speed, or speed is awful, then I shall, but otherwise not really. Think of **mystds** as the cozy slippers of Go libraries – comfy and reliable, not the fastest runners in the race, but they’ll get you where you need to go without giving you blisters.

2. **Dependency-Free Zone**
   - I am trying not to include any dependencies as this is my take on Go's std and some extra features. There are some added features on top of the std and some tiny subjective improvements. It's like adding a cherry on top of an already delicious sundae – just a little extra flair without complicating the recipe.
